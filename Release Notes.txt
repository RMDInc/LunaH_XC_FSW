Release Notes for the Mini-NS Flight Software

- Level 1 FSW - 
- This release of the FSW has no interaction; it outputs SOH packets at 1 Hz 
	and performs basic setup when powered-on.

- Level 2 FSW - 
- This release of the FSW greatly extends the level of interaction from Level 1.
	This version accepts a number of the self-terminating commands and outputs
	multiple kinds of packets in the CCSDS format. Those commands are:
	+ MNS_GETSTAT
	+ MNS_READTEMP
	+ MNS_ENABLE_ACT
	+ MNS_DISABLE_ACT
	+ MNS_TRG
	+ MNS_ECAL
	+ MNS_NGATES
	+ MNS_HV
	+ MNS_INT
	The system performs a more robust setup when powered on, including checking 
	for a configuration file. This version has no Data Acquisition and does not 
	have full support for all of the hardware available to the Mini-NS. 

- Level 3 FSW - 
- This release allows data acquisition runs, as well as transfer of the data product files after the run. 
	This version accepts the following new commands:
	+ MNS_DAQ
	+ MNS_TX
	+ MNS_START
	+ MNS_END
	+ MNS_BREAK
NOTE: There is a difference in the XC and XQ versions of this software due to a difference in hardware.
	Without an I2C connection, the XC version cannot report the analog board temperature, nor can it 
	set the HV pots. The XQ board can, as it is assumed to have the I2C connection. 
	
- Level 4 FSW -
- This release brings in updated neutron cuts which track the neutron peak as it shifts with temperature. 
	Updated capability of the FSW: can take and transfer waveform data products; new binning for 2DH and EVT
	 data products; updates to most data products, including SOH, please reference the ICD, at least version 10.4;
	A new attempt to address the issue with the transfer function has been implemented; we are waiting for the UART
	 to signal to us that it is done sending and ready to go again before compiling the next packet in the queue.
	The support programs, such as the packet reader, have been updated to handle the new data product formats.
	This version accepts the following new commands:
	+ MNS_WF
