This document serves as a list for the versions of FSW BOOT files in this folder.

Old BOOT Files - 
	This folder is a collection of older versions of the FSW which were released earlier in development. These versions are no longer supported and may have issues which later versions have solved. It is not recommended to use these.
	
Mini-NS XC FSW V1 - 
	This folder contains the Version 1 FSW for the Mini-NS. This version was capable of outputting SOH packets, but no interaction. This version may be useful for sanity checking a setup at the bare minimum. 
	- Baud Rate: 921600 bps
	
Mini-NS XC FSW V2 - 
	This version of the FSW extends the use of the version 1 FSW and allows for the Mini-NS system parameters to be set and recorded, as well as reporting the SOH packets. This version of the FSW handles Raw Bytes commands which are prepended with the CCSDS Sync Marker. This functionality was tested at ASU during the March 2019 visit.
